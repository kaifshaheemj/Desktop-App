# Desktop-App
The Domain of the project is to creating an GUI Desktop app which consists of two buttons, it lead an different function on the two buttons. 

Three Files are included in this repository

     Included Files:
        First_Button  - Task of first button which adds the random images on the canvas also move the image as single or grouply.
        Second_Button - Task of Second button which adds and group the image to drag all the image at a time on the canvas
        Local_print   - This code file prints the image in the Local 

Outlier of the Task: 
These are the Action plans that i made to do this task.
 Actions that are done befor to do this task:
  ==> How to use the canvas 
  ==> How to handle the events mouse clicks, mouse drag etc..
  ==> Probably i look into python http client to fetch the image, Since the images needs to bbe downloaded and rendered not to use the loacal image 
  ==> Download the Github folder and to set with local to randamize the appearing of the image when the add image clicked.

Then probably look into python http client to fetch the image, since the images needs to be downloaded and rendered not to use the local image
Every image in github can be fetched in raw content form for example,

If these the actions are done, then the task be fulfilled  with satisfying all the constraints that are given.

This canvas which for First button with inside window for appearing the image and move the image 

When the Add image button is clicked it will show an image from the github  directory which consists many svg images.

By keep on adding the images it will give the random image in the canvas.

This is the first button's task that is fulfilled.

 
And Another window which consists of two buttons that will download and can drag are move the multiple image from the one click. 
The Another two button canvas window is

I followed to do this task with the help of the PyQt6 Documentations and AI tools that guide me to do this on an specific manner.

I tried to randamize the images but still it doesn't running yet, i fixed lot of errors on the code i cant able to show the output after the deep searches i can't

    About My Learning and Implementing this Screening Task:

      This is my first experience of using the PyQt6 library in python, which i gave my best of my knowledge to do this task.
      The task that you gave which is not i used yet in my college projects, which is my new experience of my coding and building logic experience.
      I fulfilled the first button.
      I completed basics of PyQt6 to implement.
      In the short span of i wonder my myself have an ability  to do such different task.
      I'm expecting that to have future commitments with you to have such different experience and to upskill the knowledge that you giving to perform the task'.

                                                       Thank You
