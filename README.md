# Desktop-App
The Domain of the project is to creating an GUI Desktop app which consists of two buttons, it lead an different function on the two buttons. 

This Project consists of a Desktop App that holds two buttons with different functionalities.
In this, I done with two canvas window for the first button there will a one canvas window and
for second button ther will bw another window which second window consists of two buttons.   

Outlier of the Task: 
These are the Action plans that i made to do this task.
 Actions that are done befor to do this task:
  ==> How to use the canvas 
  ==> How to handle the events mouse clicks, mouse drag etc..
  ==> Probably i look into python http client to fetch the image, Since the images needs to bbe downloaded and rendered not to use the loacal image 
  ==> Download the Github folder and to set with local to randamize the appearing of the image when the add image clicked.

Then probably look into python http client to fetch the image, since the images needs to be downloaded and rendered not to use the local image
Every image in github can be fetched in raw content form for example,

If these the actions are done, then the task be fulfilled  with satisfying all the constraints that are given.

Which doesn't show the output after the lot of deep searches in the internet an the AI tools. 
I followed to do this task with the help of the PyQt6 Documentations and AI tools that guide me to do this on an specofic manner.

I tried to randamize the images but still it doesn't running yet, i fixed lot of errors on the code i cant able to show the output after the deep searches i can't

About My Learning and Implementing this Screening Task:

  This is my first experience of using the PyQt6 library in python, which i gave my best of my knowledge to do this task.
  The task that you gave which is not i used yet in my college projects, which is my new experience of my coding and building logic experience.
  I fulfilled the first button.
  I completed basics of PyQt6 to implement.
  In the short span of i wonder my myself have an ability  to do such different task.
  I'm expecting that to have future commitments with you to have such different experience and to upskill the knowledge that you giving to perform the task'.

                                                       Thank You
